\fI\%shmem_finalize\fP \- A collective operation that releases resources used by
the OpenSHMEM library. This only terminates the Open\-SHMEM portion of a
program, not the entire program.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fI\%shmem_finalize\fP is a collective operation that ends the OpenSHMEM portion
of a program previously initialized by \fI\%shmem_init\fP and releases resources
used by the OpenSHMEM library. This collective operation requires all
PEs to participate in the call. There is an implicit global barrier in
\fI\%shmem_finalize\fP so that pending communication is completed, and no
resources can be released until all PEs have entered \fI\%shmem_finalize\fP\&.
\fI\%shmem_finalize\fP must be the last OpenSHMEM library call encountered in
the OpenSHMEM portion of a program. A call to \fI\%shmem_finalize\fP will
release any resources initialized by a corresponding call to \fI\%shmem_init\fP\&.
All processes and threads that represent the PEs will still exist after
the call to \fI\%shmem_finalize\fP returns, but they will no longer have access
to any resources that have been released.
