[bogus section]

This section is not used by PRTE code.  But we have to put a RST
section title in this file somewhere, or Sphinx gets unhappy.  So we
put it in a section that is ignored by PRTE code.


Hello, world

We do not know how to parse this character — please contact the PRTE
help list for assistance.

[regex:end-range-missing]

[regex:num-digits-missing]

While trying to parse a regular expression to extract the node names,
the regex parser was unable to determine the number of digits in the
names:

[regex:invalid-name]

While trying to create a regular expression of the node names used in
this application, the regex parser has detected the presence of an
illegal character in the following node name:

   node:  %s

Node names must be composed of a combination of ascii letters, digits,
dots, and the hyphen ("-") character. See the following for an
explanation:
