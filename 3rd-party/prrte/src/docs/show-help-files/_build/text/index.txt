The only purpose of this file is for Sphinx to have a top-level source
RST file that includes all the others.

This file -- and the "index.txt" file that it generates -- is not used
by PRTE code.  **PRTE code only uses the individually ``help-*.txt``
files that Sphinx generates.**  The additional output files that
Sphinx generates in the "_build/text" tree are just harmelss by-
products; we ignore them.
